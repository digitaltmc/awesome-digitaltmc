* TLDR
To contribute as a developer, you can fork these repos, create Pull Requests, and ask for review.

* How to setup local dev environment

Install Golang, Docker (for running MongoDB in containers), Visual Studio Code (with Golang plugin).
Install nvm, node (latest version).

* How to set up git PR

- Set origin to point to team repo.
- Set your own remote, e.g. wcf is mine.
- `git pull` often from origin/master to keep your code synced.
- `git co -b yourDevBranch` to start development, and remember to push to your own repo, e.g. `git push wcf`. NOTE: don't push to origin!!!
